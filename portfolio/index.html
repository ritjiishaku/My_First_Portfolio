        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ritji Ishaku—a UX/UI Designer and Front-End Web Engineer with a background in healthcare as a registered nurse. My journey into UX design was driven by my passion for creating impactful digital solutions that connect with users. While working as a nurse, I noticed a gap in how many digital healthcare products failed to address user needs effectively, leading me to pivot my career toward designing solutions that truly make a difference.</p>
        <p>With over a year of experience, I specialize in crafting user-centered interfaces for healthcare digital products and early-stage startups. I focus on helping startups boost conversions, enhance user engagement, and reduce bounce rates through intuitive, clean, and user-friendly designs. My expertise extends to web and mobile applications, blending my knowledge of healthcare, front-end development, and design to deliver seamless digital experiences.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m working on a telemedicine and AI healthcare platform aligned with SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being in Africa, building both mobile and web applications to address critical healthcare challenges. My work combines innovation and empathy, ensuring accessible and meaningful solutions for diverse users.</p>
        <p>When I’m not designing, you can find me exploring cutting-edge technologies like AI/ML and generative AI or brainstorming ways to align digital solutions with global challenges. My mission is to create experiences that drive both business growth and user satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Let’s connect and create something impactful together!</p>
